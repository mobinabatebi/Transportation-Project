Taxi Trip Data Analysis and Machine Learning Models
This repository contains a comprehensive workflow for analyzing, processing, and building machine learning models on the 2021 NYC Green Taxi Trip Dataset. The code includes advanced data preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, and predictive modeling approaches to analyze taxi trip data and derive insights.

Features
1. Data Preprocessing
Loading the NYC Green Taxi dataset and related borough information.
Cleaning data by handling missing values using regression and classification methods.
Transforming date and time fields to extract useful features (e.g., hour, day, and weekday).
Encoding categorical variables such as boroughs using one-hot encoding.
Dropping irrelevant or redundant columns to streamline the dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing activity levels using a heatmap of trips by hour and weekday.
Analyzing trip type and payment type distributions by hour using bar plots.
Assessing green taxi usage trends across boroughs and hours.
3. Feature Engineering and Selection
Backward Elimination: Removing features iteratively to optimize model performance.
Forward Selection: Adding features incrementally to find the most predictive variables.
Random Forest Feature Importance: Using Random Forest to select features with the highest importance scores.
Chi-Square Test: Selecting features based on statistical relevance.
4. Predictive Modeling
Classification Models:
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Evaluating models using accuracy and classification reports for predicting tipping behavior.
Regression Models:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Comparing models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
5. Model Comparison
A detailed comparison of regression models for predicting the total fare amount.
Identifying the best-performing model using evaluation metrics.
Visualizations
Heatmaps for activity levels by time and day.
Bar plots for trip and payment type distributions.
Correlation matrix for feature relationships.
Borough-specific trends in green taxi usage.
